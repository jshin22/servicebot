# Servicebot

"Servicebot" uses artificial intelligence to provide users with different types of community service opportunities that suits their best interest based on their personalities. 

## Getting Started

Upload any piece of writing about yourself (ex: resume, cover letter, etc...) and the program will analyze the user's personality based on 16 personalities - MBTI. Subsequently, the program will recommend community service opportunities of the user's best interest. 

### Prerequisites

- Step 1: Make sure you have Python

### Installing

- Step 2: Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running the tests

- Step 3: Go to this app's directory and run `python app.py`

## Deployment

Once the user isntall Python and run 'python app.py' at console, the server will run. Then, the user will be able to access it through a web browser, where they can upload a piece of writing about themselves. After the upload, the program will analyze the user's personaility through XGboost's classifier algorithm and recommend a volunteer activity or a CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility). The developer can update many volunteer activities, using recommender.py.
